# Mathematical Expression Construction

Machine learning exercise on learning mathematical
expressions by obsering graphs. The objective is
to construct the mathematical expression that best
matches a graph. The most "elegant" solution must
be found, so simply approximating with a polyonym
is not considered a good solution.
